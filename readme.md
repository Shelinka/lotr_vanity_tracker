This is a Discord bot that tracks vanity metrics and manages user roles based on achievement thresholds. The bot monitors user activity, logs commands, on Lord of the Rings server.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository or download the project files

2. Install the required dependencies:

```

3. Configure the bot token in `.env` and channel/role IDs in `.conf` with your Discord server settings

## Future Improvements

Configurable metrics (right now it's all manual .conf setup in the root directory, wanna at some point streamline it but ¯\(°_o)/¯ yolo)
Custom bot status for funzies (maybe with uptime as a game time, i dunno..)
